# Inspecting persona development

Personas can respond to actual experience by refining their characteristic
fragments during ordinary work. A fragment expresses the persona's intended
attention, judgment, voice or conduct. Task knowledge and procedures remain
supporting assets. A saved refinement does not by itself establish changed
behavior or improved results.

## Give feedback within existing work

The saved requester can address an existing participant without creating a new
work item. Put the feedback in a local JSON file, replacing the work and persona
placeholders with existing identifiers:

```json
{
  "id": "review-direction",
  "work": "WORK_ID",
  "persona": "PERSONA_ID",
  "text": "Please explain how you addressed the outstanding review comments."
}
```

```sh
ai-personas --state-root /private/personas-state --operator requester \
  feedback feedback.json
```

The runtime attributes this input to the requester. It preserves the full
permitted feedback across reads, waits and local stops until the recipient
explicitly records a handled or declined disposition with a reason. Unresolved
feedback remains pending. Exact replay queues nothing twice; conflicting reuse
of the same identifier fails.

Feedback does not resume a stopped persona or replenish its resources. Continue
through the existing foreground session, explicitly resuming a stopped
participant when appropriate. The persona chooses whether the experience calls
for a task correction, characteristic refinement, supporting asset change or
reasoned no change. Feedback does not require a character edit.

Peer feedback can also remain active across several steps. The recipient chooses
which actual messages need this treatment with `AccountPeerFeedback`, marking
each as pending, handled or declined. Pending messages keep their full permitted
bodies and the recipient's reason in subsequent context until explicitly resolved.
Ordinary conversation does not automatically become a continuing obligation.
This choice creates neither a peer commitment nor an automatic wake or extra
resources; the persona still authors its continuation separately.

## Inspect retained guidance and actual supply

The development view reports currently permitted characteristic revisions and
their authorship without making a model call:

```sh
ai-personas --state-root /private/personas-state --operator requester \
  development PERSONA_ID
```

To inspect one retained source and a later accepted invocation:

```sh
ai-personas --state-root /private/personas-state --operator requester \
  development PERSONA_ID --source SOURCE_ID --invocation INVOCATION_ID
```

The invocation view checks the exact full fragment body in the retained input,
its accepted response record, and whether a completed direct-provider receipt
matches that input. It distinguishes selected context from a completed read
supplied as an observation. Discovery metadata, a selected reference without
its body, and an uncompleted read do not establish actual supply.

Optional selections belong to a work. Reusing a refinement in another work
requires that persona's own selection or an authorized character adoption;
retention alone does not add it to every later prompt. A permitted character
adoption still requires a fresh decision before ordinary work continues.

Inspect later actions and their consequences separately. Full-body supply shows
what the model received, not what caused its decision or whether its behavior
improved. Missing or inaccessible evidence remains unavailable.

Keep operational stores, feedback files, model outputs and inspection records
local. They can contain task content and persona history. The public repository
documents the commands and contracts rather than individual run records.

See the [runtime reference](../RUNTIME-REFERENCE.md) for feedback limits,
continuation rules, current permission checks and closure requirements.
